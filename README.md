# Kovaaks-Parser-CptS475
A script which parses the information in KovaaK's .csv files. Made for a class project. 

Takes a folder containing many subfolders as input. Each subfolder can have n files each (4 in my case), and generic KovaaK's .csv content like scenario name, shots, hits, misses, and sensitivity will be extracted from each scenario into a single row in a new output.csv. The scenarios in output.csv will be organized based on the date in their filenames. Demonstration below.
